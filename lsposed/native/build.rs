//! Build-time glue for the lsposed native cdylib (`libvpnhide_checks.so`).
//!
//! Only purpose right now: align ELF LOAD segments on 16 KiB so the
//! library loads cleanly on 16 KiB-page Android devices (Pixel 8 Pro on
//! Android 16, and any future hardware that ships with 16 KiB pages by
//! default). NDK r28+ already does this by default, but passing the flag
//! explicitly keeps r27 builds compatible too — defence in depth.
