## v1.12.1

### Changed
- Optimize JSON configuration storage to only persist apps with active protections

### Fixed
- Prevent the daemon from selecting `dummy0` (or another `dummy*` routing-anchor netdev) as the physical cover interface or spoof-IP source

## v1.12.0

### Changed
- Cache physical interface name from daemon and eliminate redundant ConnectivityService IPC calls
- Migrate companion app local storage from SQLite to a single JSON configuration file in Device Protected Storage with a one-time startup migration screen
- Migrate kernel module configuration load path to read vpnhide_config.json directly on boot via parson, removing the sqlite3 CLI binary and reducing module zip size
- Optimize loadTargetUids by caching selfUid to prevent expensive reflection calls on every binder invocation
- Refactor ConnectivityService Network-handle hooks into a shared helper to eliminate per-method boilerplate
- App list loads instantly from disk cache on startup
- Hide successful diagnostics checks by default and display a simplified status card; show only failed checks if any check fails
- Require the kernel module (kmod) to be installed and active on app startup.
- Switched daemon interface detection from /proc/net/route heuristics to Active Probing via SO_BINDTODEVICE.

### Fixed
- Android 17: migrate NetworkCapabilities sanitization to public API so NC hook is not skipped on renamed private fields
- Bound netlink diagnostic recv loops and add SO_RCVTIMEO to prevent OOM crash when kmod suppresses NLMSG_DONE
- Fix name resolution of Work Profile applications on the Intercept Statistics and Scope screen
- Fix clearing of LSPosed framework hook statistics on dashboard reset
- Fix dashboard expanding multiple statistics cards for apps with the same package name in different user profiles by keying on UID instead of package name

### Removed
- Remove FAQ screen and button from the main app interface

## v1.11.0

### Added
- Added UserManager hooks to hide work profiles from targeted apps
- Implement RCU-based active VPN interface caching inside the kernel module driven by the daemon, eliminating runtime string matching and netdev traversals on hot BPF paths

### Changed
- Migrated remaining hardcoded UI strings to localized resources
- Migrated socket bind, connect, and getsockname hooks to top-level syscall wrappers to prevent bypasses via inlining
- Optimize all kretprobe hooks to return 1 early from entry handlers for non-target UIDs and non-matching requests, skipping return handler execution and releasing kretprobe resources instantly
- Optimize hot-path locking and memory copying (RCU for spoof IP, stack arrays for BPF, get/put_user for socket options)
- Optimize __sys_bpf hot paths by adding fast-path filter checks and rapid switch matching
- Optimized kretprobe hooks by skipping return handlers for non-target processes, significantly reducing CPU overhead
- Remove dev_get_by_index_rcu lookups from setsockopt and getsockopt hooks, using active VPN cache for SO_BINDTOIFINDEX instead
- Updated hook card titles in Hook Isolation screen to show user-friendly names instead of technical identifiers
- Updated Hook Isolation screen to match recent kernel-level hook refactorings and migrated all UI strings to localized resources
- Removed all /data/system config files, replacing file observers with direct /dev/vpnhide_ctrl kernel blocking reads.
